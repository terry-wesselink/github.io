                                <p>Writing WeeFree Women and setting up this
                                    website has been a long journey for me with
                                    several false starts and hiccups along the
                                    way. The idea for WeeFree Women grew out of
                                    my own experience of incontinence as a
                                    teenager and young adult. The veil of
                                    secrecy drawn across this common problem
                                    and the limited information available led
                                    me to suffer in emabarrased silence and
                                    ignorance for many years.</p>
                                <p>I studied physiotherapy with the aim of
                                    curing the world's pains, but along the way
                                    discovered the work of Pauline Chiarelli
                                    and other women's health physiotherapists
                                    and realised that my problem with
                                    incontinence was not only common, but
                                    completely curable through effective pelvic
                                    floor training. I was able to use my new
                                    found knowledge to vastly improve my own
                                    life and started to wonder how many other
                                    women were suffering for the want of a
                                    little bit of knowledge.</p>
                                <p>When my children were little I was involved
                                    in some wonderful parents groups and an
                                    early childhood education cooperative in
                                    New Zealand called Playcentre (<a
                                            target="_blank"
                                            href="http://www.playcentre.org.nz"
                                            title="http://www.playcentre.org.nz">http://www.playcentre.org.nz</a>).
                                    I found that some of my well read, vibrant,
                                    knowledge hungry friends were having the
                                    same problems with incontinence that I was,
                                    and that they too had been suffering in
                                    silence and ignorance. I started wondering
                                    how I could spread the knowledge about
                                    incontinence and it's cure to all the new
                                    mums. My chance came when I was invited to
                                    be part of the foundation committee for a
                                    new parent program called SPACE (You can
                                    read more about the program at <a
                                            target="_blank"
                                            href="http://www.space.org.nz"
                                            title="http://www.space.org.nz">http://www.space.org.nz</a>).&nbsp;
                                    I volunteered to be the guest speaker at
                                    several of the pilot sites and my topic was
                                    "Looking after your pelvic floor after
                                    having a baby". The program still includes
                                    a guest speaker and I'm sure that sometimes
                                    it's a women's health physio, but my
                                    involvement ended when our family relocated
                                    to Australia.</p>
                                <p>After the move I spent a few years working
                                    long hours in a harsh corporate environment
                                    to help boost the family coffers. When I
                                    found myself working unpaid over weekends
                                    and having to protect my team from a
                                    bullying boss, I decided it was time to get
                                    back to helping women with
                                    incontinence.</p>
                                <p>Australia has a fantastic body of knowledge
                                    about incontinence and there is lots of
                                    research being done here to support the
                                    work that physio's do to cure incontinence,
                                    but this knowledge still isn't reaching the
                                    average woman.</p>
                                <p>While the work I do with individual women is
                                    helpful, there are still millions of women
                                    both here in my adopted country and in
                                    other parts of the world whose only help
                                    with incontinence is the pad they
                                    surrepticiously wear each day. So I decided
                                    to write a book and set up a website where
                                    women could come together to share their
                                    experiences, learn what can be done to
                                    prevent or cure incontinence and join me in
                                    the effort to spread the message to other
                                    women.</p>
                                <p>The book was finally published in September
                                    2011, but soon after it was published I
                                    developed a serious heart problem. Due to
                                    delays in correctly diagnosing my problem,
                                    I was largely incapacitated for almost 9
                                    months. I gave up all hope of ever getting
                                    this website finished or being able to
                                    spread the WeeFree message. Luckily, a
                                    brave young doctor dared to disagree with
                                    the cardiology consultant's diagnosis which
                                    set in motion a series of events that saw
                                    me fitted with a pacemaker a few days
                                    later. I'm forever grateful to that doctors
                                    courage to disagree with a senior's
                                    opinion, because it saved my life.</p>
                                <p>Getting my pacemaker has been like having a
                                    new beginning. I am picking up the pieces
                                    where I dropped them all those months ago.
                                    The website is active and I'm ready to
                                    spread the WeeFree message once again.</p>
