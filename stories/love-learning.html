                                <p>A friend of mine once admitted that she was
                                    uncertain if she attends learning events
                                    because she loves giving her patients the
                                    best possible treatment or whether she
                                    treats her patients to fund her love of
                                    learning. I must admit that I have the same
                                    problem; I love attending conferences and
                                    other learning events just as much as I
                                    love helping my patients to get better.</p>
                                <p>Last month I was lucky enough to be able to
                                    travel to Perth for the 22nd National
                                    Conference on Incontinence. I got to see an
                                    Australian city that I have never visited
                                    before, visit a colleague from University
                                    days and I got to spend 4 days in the
                                    company of learned physiotherapists,
                                    gynaecologists, urologists, nurses,
                                    gastroentorologists, psychologists and even
                                    a sexologist from Singapore.</p>

                                    you may have noticed the stream of snippets
                                    from the conference tagged #CFAConf13. I
                                    also got to meet some of the interesting
                                    people I follow on Twitter and put a face
                                    to the Tweets. </p>
                                <p>To reinforce the importance of events such
                                    as these, more than one speaker mentioned
                                    that it takes up to 17 years for research
                                    with level/1 grade A evidence (that's the
                                    highest level), be adopted by the medical
                                    profession as usual practice. One example
                                    given is that research evidence and
                                    international guidelines recommend that all
                                    pregnant and postnatal women should receive
                                    pelvic floor muscle training to prevent and
                                    treat urinary incontinence, yet this is not
                                    yet usual practice. Physiotherapist Helena
                                    Frawley presented her research on the
                                    uptake of this practice by primary
                                    maternity care providers in a public health
                                    network and the barriers encountered. </p>
                                <p>I spent a half day learning about the latest
                                    treatments available for over active
                                    bladder OAB; from drugs and injections to
                                    electrical currents and brain training.
                                    This topic needs an entire  posting of
                                    it's own. I must say that the recent ABC
                                    program by Todd Sampson on Redesigning your
                                    Brain has me doubly excited about this
                                    seemingly impossible problem.</p>
                                <p>There were several excellent presentations
                                    on Pelvic Organ Prolapse or POP which was
                                    most simply described as “a hernia”. A
                                    debate between the gynaecologists and
                                    physiotherapists on whether pelvic floor
                                    physiotherapy should be offered as a first
                                    line treatment was won hands-down by the
                                    pelvic floor physiotherapists according to
                                    the audience. It was a difficult debate for
                                    the gynaecologists because they all
                                    supported the affirmative and found
                                    themselves arguing for conservative
                                    treatment as a first option with a few rare
                                    exceptions.</p>
                                <p>Dr Ian Tucker presented the current issues
                                    around the use of meshes and the hazards
                                    associated with mesh surgery, and Dr Chris
                                    Maher highlighted the low level of clinical
                                    researchinto the use of mesh in vaginal
                                    prolapse repair versus the older native
                                    tissue repairs. But there is some promising
                                    new research being done into the
                                    possibility of tissue engineering to enable
                                    POP repairs to be done using a woman's own
                                    cells.</p>
                                <p>Another conservative treatment that was
                                    discussed was the use of a Pessary to
                                    manage the POP either long term, as a
                                    temporary measure while pelvic floor muscle
                                    training is implemented or to delay the
                                    need for surgical repair. Traditionally
                                    fitted by gynaecologists there are now some
                                    nurse practitioners and physiotherapists
                                    trained to assess and fit pessaries.</p>
                                <p>There were talks on treating constipation,
                                    conservative and surgical options to treat
                                    urinary incontinence following
                                    prostatectomy, a sexologists viewpoint on
                                    pelvic floor muscle training, bedwetting,
                                    pelvic pain, the psychology of the
                                    bathroom, catheter selection and how to
                                    communicate so that patients understand and
                                    adhere to the treatment prescribed.</p>
                                <p>For me the most fascinating talk was by a
                                    medical scientist, Associate Professor
                                    Phil Dinning. Phil has been researching
                                    functional gastrointestinal disorders for
                                    20 years. He shared some unexpected
                                    findings about the colon which were brought
                                    to light by a new Fibre-Optic manometry
                                    catheter which he helped develop. The new
                                    type of catheter is able to make detailed
                                    measurements of gut motility. It seems that
                                    there is more activity in a healthy gut
                                    than any of us imagined. The old measuring
                                    devices could detect large sweeping actions
                                    which propel gut contents towards the
                                    rectum, what was previously undetectable,
                                    and very surprising, is that the gut also
                                    has many much smaller waves carrying the
                                    contents away from the rectum. It is
                                    possible that these smaller waves play a
                                    role in faecal continence and may give some
                                    explanation as to why Sacral Nerve
                                    Stimulation is so successful in reducing
                                    faecal incontinence in people who get no
                                    relief from other treatments. Of course the
                                    research is ongoing, but what we know so
                                    far is enough to get us all thinking.</p>
                                <p>The Continence foundation presented their
                                    language specific web pages and the
                                    advertisement they created to raise
                                    awareness of incontinence, with it's really
                                    catchy tune. You can

                                    with a dinner and dance on the Friday
                                    night. The band was so good that I danced
                                    until almost midnight and I was told the
                                    next day that good music and food is
                                    traditionally provided at every CFA
                                    conference, so I have my calendar marked
                                    next year's conference in Cairns. Perhaps I
                                    can drag my husband along next time..</p>
