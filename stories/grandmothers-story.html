                                <p>Maria is a 75 year old grandmother with time
                                    for everyone else except herself. This is a
                                    story she shared with me
                                    recently.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Last year when <a
                                        href="../content/book.html">WeeFree
                                    Women</a> had just been
                                    published, I was very excited about sharing
                                    my work with my friends and I posted Maria
                                    a copy of the book to read.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Unknown to me she had been experiencing
                                    increasing discomfort in the pelvic floor
                                    region during the day for about a year. She
                                    says it felt like her insides were pushing
                                    down between her legs. The discomfort eased
                                    when she sat down or lay in bed at night.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Eventually she decided she would seek
                                    medical advice. Her local doctor diagnosed
                                    a prolapsed bladder or cystocoele and she
                                    was advised to make an appointment to see a
                                    specialist gynaecologist for surgical
                                    repair. The earliest appointment was 6
                                    weeks later.</p>
                                <p>By chance my book reached her that week.</p>
                                <p>Maria started reading. She followed all the
                                    advice (except the bit about coffee), she
                                    did the exercises without fail twice a day,
                                    every day.</p>
                                <p>After the first week she noticed the
                                    discomfort was easing, after 4 weeks she no
                                    longer had any discomfort during her usual
                                    activities. She did sometimes feel
                                    uncomfortable if she had to strain on the
                                    toilet, but used the advice in the book to
                                    protect her pelvic floor.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>When she finally saw the specialist, she was
                                    told that she did indeed have a prolapse,
                                    but it was only a minor one and would not
                                    need surgical repair.</p>
                                <p>Maria believes that reading WeeFree Women
                                    and following the program saved her from
                                    surgery.</p>
                                <p>Maria's experience is not an isolated or
                                    unique one. A recent multi-centre study
                                    into the effectiveness of Pelvic Floor
                                    Muscle Training for Prolapse management,
                                    found that women who receieved pelvic flor
                                    muscle training had better symptom
                                    outcomes. See <a target="_blank"
