                                <p>The following story is about a young woman
                                    who consulted me about a “weak bladder”.
                                    Sue (not her real name) was worried about a
                                    few episodes of urine leakage a few weeks
                                    after the birth of her second child and
                                    sensibly decided to consult a pelvic floor
                                    physiotherapist.</p>
                                <p>Sue had experienced a loss of urine on her
                                    way to the toilet a couple of times after
                                    feeding her baby. Both times she had been
                                    very busy during the day and the
                                    incontinence episodes occurred in the late
                                    afternoon. At the time she also had a cold
                                    and had been sneezing a lot.</p>
                                <p>Of course my first thought was that she may
                                    have weak pelvic floor muscles causing some
                                    stress incontinence, especially as she
                                    revealed that she had difficulty with
                                    pelvic floor muscle contractions taught to
                                    her postnatally and wasn't sure if she was
                                    doing the right thing.</p>
                                <p>Careful questioning revealed that she had a
                                    habit of putting off emptying her bladder
                                    and could usually hold on for hours. A full
                                    history also revealed a history of
                                    constipation and a fear of public toilets.
                                    She also had a lot of flatus which caused
                                    painful cramps at times, but she was able
                                    to control her flatus and never “let go” in
                                    public.</p>
                                <p>An examination of her pelvic floor muscles
                                    found that far from having weak pelvic
                                    floor muscles, Sue's pelvic floor was in a
                                    constant state of tension. She could not
                                    feel the muscles contract, because they
                                    were already pretty tight. It was a bit
                                    like trying to do a biceps curl with your
                                    hand strapped to your shoulder - you can't
                                    lift if you can let go.</p>
                                <p>We also found that Sue did not have a good
                                    reflex pelvic floor contraction to
                                    counteract a cough or sneeze. This is more
                                    common than one would think and is
                                    particularly common during pregnancy and
                                    after childbirth.</p>
                                <p>So Sue did have stress incontinence, but not
                                    because of weak pelvic floor muscles.
                                    Instead of her muscles being reactive to
                                    the stresses on them and being able to
                                    respond to these by contracting when
                                    needed, they were in a state of constant
                                    tension. This tension was enough to keep
                                    her continent most of the time, but in the
                                    late afternoon her pelvic floor muscles
                                    were in a state of fatigue, with no
                                    reserves to counteract a full bladder and
                                    repeated stresses from the sneezing.</p>
                                <p>With help Sue learned to relax her pelvic
                                    floor muscles first then how to activate
                                    them when needed. Once she was able to
                                    release the pelvic floor, she was actually
                                    able to increase the strength of the
                                    muscles as well.</p>
                                <p>Her constipation also turned out to be
                                    caused by her overactive pelvic floor
                                    muscles. The constipation resolved when she
                                    learnt correct posture and toilet
                                    techniques, and the flatus
                                    went away when she stopped taking a
                                    lot of fibre supplements.</p>
                                <p>Sue's story serves as a good reminder that
                                    while many people can benefit from self
                                    help exercises, not everyone is able to
                                    learn how to do them properly on their own
                                    and not every case of urinary incontinence
                                    is due to weak pelvic floor muscles.</p>
                                <p>If Sue had carried on ignoring her problem,
                                    she could have developed other problems
                                    such as anal fissures, pelvic pain and
                                    vaginismus. Luckily for her she sought help
                                    early.</p>
                                <p>If you're struggling with your WeeFree
                                    exercises or you have other symptoms such
                                    as constipation, discomfort during sex or
                                    pelvic pain, make sure you consult a
                                    physiotherapist or medical professional
                                    with training in Pelvic Floor function to
                                    get more help.</p>
