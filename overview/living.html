                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Millions of women struggle with incontinence
                                    on a daily basis and many of them have
                                    found ways of dealing with their problem
                                    through hiding it. Their biggest fear is
                                    discovery through smelling of urine or even
                                    worse having visible leakage.</p>
                                <p>Most incontinent women believe their
                                    situation is normal and have no idea that
                                    there is hope of a cure. Even if you have
                                    discovered the WeeFree book and are working
                                    towards becoming dry, you may still need a
                                    little protection from time to time.</p>
                                <h3>Toilet Maps</h3>
                                <p>Knowing the location of toilet facilities
                                    when you go out can provide much needed
                                    peace of mind when you have a problem with
                                    incontinence and there are some great
                                    toilet location resources in some cities.
                                    Links to the toilet maps we know about can
                                    be found under the resources Tab. Please <a
                                            href="../contact.html">contact
                                        us</a> if
                                    you know of a good toilet locator app or
                                    website.</p>
                                <p>You should be able to "hold on" when your
                                    bladder is full until there is a convenient
                                    time and place to "let go". Knowing where
                                    the nearest toilet is, makes life so much
                                    easier if your "hold" is not yet as strong
                                    as it ought to be . Avoid visiting every
                                    toilet you pass. Emptying your bladder
                                    before it has a chance to fill can increase
                                    your problems and reduce your bladder
                                    capacity.</p>
                                <h3>Liners and Pads</h3>
                                <p>If you have mild stress incontinence you
                                    might use a daily panty-liner or if you are
                                    planning a more active outing you may wear
                                    an ordinary sanitary pad. If you leak
                                    larger quantities, you will get better
                                    protection from a purpose designed
                                    incontinence pad. These are designed to
                                    absorb urine rather than your menstrual
                                    flow and can usually hold greater volumes
                                    and the leak guards are more suited to the
                                    lower viscosity of urine.</p>
                                <p>If you have urge incontinence and sometimes
                                    have your bladder empty fully with very
                                    little warning, you may need to use one of
                                    the many adult diapers available. Some of
                                    women even wear a diaper as well as an
                                    extra "liner pad" to cope with long
                                    journeys or to get through a show. A wet
                                    pad or diaper should always be changed as
                                    soon as possible or rather as soon as it is
                                    convenient.</p>
                                <p>Contrary to common belief it is very rare to
                                    smell of urine if you use appropriate
                                    continence aids and it is possible to find
                                    a product for your type and severity of
                                    incontinence that almost eliminates the
                                    possibility of fluid leakage. The adult
                                    diaper industry is worth billions, so you
                                    can be assured there are plenty of top
                                    quality products available to hide
                                    incontinence.</p>
                                <h3>Vaginal splints</h3>
                                <p>Some women find that they have more control
                                    when they insert a tampon. The tampon acts
                                    as a splint which helps compress the
                                    urethra when you tighten your pelvic floor.
                                    It can be difficult to insert and remove
                                    tampons when you are not menstruating and
                                    Tampons can cause toxic shock syndrome if
                                    not changed frequently.</p>
                                <p>Therefore a better option is to use a hollow
                                    medical grade splint, such as a contiform
                                    device, designed specifically for the
                                    purpose. These can be fitted by a women's
                                    health physio or continence nurse.
                                    Continence splints are designed for
                                    temporary or intermittant use and should
                                    not be confused with vaginal pessaries
                                    which are used to reduce vaginal
                                    prolapse.</p>
